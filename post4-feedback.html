                I received my first feedback from Daphne Heertjes, and it read as follows:

                &quot;Hi Marcus,
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                Welcome to the course! Thank you for filling in the form, 
                clear story and very evident what you are looking for. Good luck with your finals in advance, 
                since they start today. You&apos;re not the only one of our students who wants to go into IT 
                because they like video games. Do keep in mind that we are an all round education 
                and don&apos;t specifically focus on gaming. Other educations are better for that. 
                We have 1 project 8 weeks in where you learn to create an educational game 
                but outside of that it is much more about making assignments for businesses using 
                software development applications or data science. You also learn to work in teams and develop personal skills. 
                All this to nudge your expectations in the right direction a little. 
                What you could do for example is a minor or internship in that direction in your third year 
                so you can add that to your CV if you want to join a video game company for your job.
            </p>

                We have an info session at the start of June and another in July, 
                in case you have any questions you could always ask them there! 
                You can find more info about those at the forum and on the SCC home page.
            </p>

                See you there,

                After reading this feedback I did change my expectations a bit, 
                and now do plan to focus more on game development specifically in my internship in the third year, 
                rather than throughout the entire education.
