            For the last company I took a look at Vertigo Games, 
            which is once again different from the previous two. 
            Namely, it specializes in creating and both funding and publishing VR games. 
            Also very interestingly, they have an entirely separate branch for 
            funding and publishing VR arcades, where a large room and VR equipment 
            is provided to play some form of VR game. Some of their own games include 
            After the Fall, Skyworld and Arizona Sunshine. To name a few of the games 
            they helped publish, there is A Fisherman&apos;s Tale and Traffic Jams.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            When it comes to IT they employ both Engineers and Developers 
            for various forms of software, including gameplay, graphics, physics and networking. 
            They mainly use their proprietary content distribution platform “Haze”, 
            which also acts as the launcher for most, if not all of their games. 
            Of course they also have the usual systems for IT employees to use and edit, 
            such as graphics systems, rendering game systems, networking game systems, 
            cloud-based servers and a custom physics system. Finally, 
            they also use the SpringboardVR platform.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            Unfortunately I couldn&apos;t find much about their company culture, 
            but I did find that they are very proud of their ability to create 
            “cutting-edge, high-quality VR games that offer unrivaled immersion, 
            realizing the stoutest dreams of gamers everywhere”.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            In conclusion, this VR game company strives for the best in VR games, 
            and often works together with other developers and companies to accomplish this goal. 
            What I like most about the company is definitely the focus on VR, 
            as this sets it apart from most other game companies.
