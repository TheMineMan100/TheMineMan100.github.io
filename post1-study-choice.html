                When choosing what to study, I made it a point to inform myself about my options. 
                In order to inform myself better, I decided to attend several open days at the HZ, among others. 
                I also made sure to visit the webpages of the different courses and schools and to read up on them as much as I could, 
                while also finding other sources as well. In particular, I was looking for a course that would teach me how to create my own programs. 
                Why, you ask?
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been playing video games for my entire life. I have also always had a knack for learning languages, 
                so when combining those two factors a career involving programming languages quickly seemed like 
                the logical choice. During this course I will truly be able to hone my insight and skills 
                in the field of programming, since I will be able to experience a more hands-on approach than other courses might offer. 
                I will actually be able to experience what it&apos;s like to write programs, be it alone or in a team with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are of course skills I will need in order to work in the field I want to work in: 
                being a part of creating video games. I plan on mainly working with the actual game mechanics, 
                such as running and jumping, along with more involved mechanics like the pogo maneuver you can find in 
                games like Hollow Knight and Shovel Knight. Of course, this is not what this course is teaching exactly, 
                but it is a perfect stepping stone, since I will be learning plenty of skills that will be useful, 
                directly or indirectly. In the case I can&apos;t make it in the field of video games, 
                a very nice alternative of course is to work as a programmer in a different kind of company, 
                much like what was shown off in one of the open days. I could, for example, write programs that 
                simulate various scenarios to determine the chances of failure and success.
