            The second company I took a look at was Abstraction Games. 
            This company is different in a major way from Guerilla Games, 
            since rather than focussing entirely on their own IPs, 
            they mainly co-develop other companies&apos; 
            IPs and help with porting them to various platforms. 
            Said companies tend to be developers of various AAA games, 
            such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Baldur&apos;s Gate 3 
            and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            Their IT roles consist of designers, administrators and programmers. 
            Said IT personnel uses its own IT infrastructure and firmware. 
            They also use dev kits and test kits, 
            which include various prototypes for hardware and software sent 
            to Abstraction Games by large companies such as Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. 
            They also use the Parsec software which connects two devices together, 
            allowing one device to make software, such as a video game, 
            run on another device. Lastly, they use the Silverware game engine 
            which is developed in-house.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            Abstraction Games has a number of core values which they 
            heavily encourage employees to follow. These encourage employees 
            to go beyond their boundaries and to excel. They also include 
            being nice to one another, including being punctual, and 
            heavily encourage growth as a developer.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p>
            As for my personal thoughts on the company, the part I definitely 
            enjoy the most is how varied the work can get, 
            considering you will constantly be working with different companies and developers. 
            The company has many good connections to other studios and companies, 
            which can make the work more varied. All in all, it is a very interesting company.
