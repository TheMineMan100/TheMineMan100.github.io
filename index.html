              <p>Welcome to the home page of this little profile site I made!</p>
              <p>Here, I will be convincing you why I believe the HBO-ICT course
                and the field of IT in general suit

                I will giving more information about myself
                and I will explain how I got here. I will do so with:

                <h2>My Motivation</h2>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  I have been playing video games since I was a child,
                  and I have always wanted a job in the industry. You see,
                  I was fascinated by both the entertainment these games provided,
                  and the technical ingenuity that must have gone into them to make
                  them look and feel the way they did. It didn't take very long for me to
                  feel like I wanted to be able to create such experiences as well.
                </p>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  Back then, I didn't yet know why I was so interested in video games and soon
                  programming as a whole; I could only think of the entertainment these things
                  provided. Now, however, I have seen some of the work that goes into these programs;
                  I have watched videos made by developers that regularly show their progress on
                  a project, I have seen behind-the-scenes footage at various studios and
                  I had even tried my hand at creating a small game myself. All in all
                  I have found that one of the main reasons I am so fascinated is because I have
                  so much respect for the people who are able to put in all this work. And
                  most of all: I want to learn how to create such programs myself.
                  Not only to see the fruits of that labor, but to feel the pride and satisfaction
                  that comes from achieving something that felt so out of reach.

                <h2>The HZ
                  <a href="https://hz.nl/" target="_blank">
                    <img src="https://portal.hz.nl/dist/en/hz-logo.1cca39008849a0cfaeb8.svg" 
                         alt="HZ logo" 
                         id="hz-logo">
                  </a>
                </h2>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  Now that leaves the obvious question: why do I want to learn all this at
                  the HZ in particular?
                </p>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  The first and simplest reason is proximity. I live in Kruiningen, in the
                  east of Zeeland, which makes the HZ one of the closest schools to me that
                  provide a course in IT. There were quite a few schools that I did consider,
                  but that wouldn't be practical to attend since I would either have to move
                  or regularly make a very long commute of several hours.
                  Neither of these options were very appealing to me, since I am quite
                  comfortable where I live right now and don't want to wake up unnecessarily
                  early, since I wouldn't realistically be able to get
                  eight hours of sleep every day.
                </p>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  The second reason is the quality of the education at the HZ.
                  Throughout my last few years at my previous school I went to
                  open days held by various schools that provide a course in
                  IT or a similar subject. Of course, I also went to two separate
                  open days at the HZ. Out of these educations, the HZ stuck out
                  among the rest for the quality of its facilities, education
                  and connections to companies, mainly throughout Zeeland,
                  but also the rest of the world. As such the HZ not only provides
                  a good education, but can also serve as a stepping stone to get
                  into a job at a company of your liking.
                </p>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  Of course, the HZ doesn't provide a course specifically aimed at game
                  development. While this is unfortunate, I am also not yet dead-set on
                  becoming a game developer. As such, the more multipurpose education
                  at the HZ, which also involves generally learning to program in teams
                  and presenting ideas to higher-ups, is much more useful to me in the long term
                  than a specific education in game development would be.
                </p>
  
                <br>
  
                <p>
                  Altogether this means that I feel the HZ HBO-ICT course is the right
                  course for me to follow.
