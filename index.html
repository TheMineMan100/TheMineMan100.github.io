              <p>Welcome to the home page of this little portfolio site I made!</p>
              <p>Here, I will be convincing you why I believe the HBO-ICT course
                and the field of IT in general suit
                <a href="profile.html">me</a>. On the other pages of this site
                I will giving more information about myself
                and I will explain how I got here. I will do so with:

                <h2>My Motivation</h2>
  
                <p id="home-motivation-end">
                  Since I&apos;ve been playing video games for my entire life, 
                  I have always had a fascination with them. As such, it didn&apos;t 
                  take long before I also took an interest in the process behind creating one. 
                  When I started looking up more information, I quickly found a deep respect 
                  within myself for the people who are able to create these programs, 
                  these experiences. Some time after, I realized I wanted to be able to 
                  do that too, to feel that same respect that I feel for those developers 
                  for myself.
                </p>
  
                <h2>The HZ

                </h2>
  
                <p class="last-element">
                  When I started looking for places to study programming, 
                  I soon came across the HZ. Not only is it close to where I live, in Kruiningen, 
                  the quality of the education is also superb. When I started comparing 
                  different educations, the HZ held up as being amongst the top choices. 
                  Soon it felt like a no-brainer. The only downside is that the course 
                  isn&apos;t aimed at game development, but that is hardly a setback 
                  as the program can easily serve as a stepping stone into game development 
                  regardless. Not only that, but if I decide not to pursue a career in 
                  game development after all, the HBO-ICT course at the HZ is broad 
                  in a way that it allows me to pursue a different career as a programmer 
                  outside of game development.
