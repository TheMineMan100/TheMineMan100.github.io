            I&apos;ll be starting this post by discussing Guerilla Games. 
            Their core business is to create and publish their own video game IPs, 
            or Intellectual Properties, with their currently most well-known IP being 
            the Horizon series, including Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, 
            along with Horizon Call of the Mountain which is yet to be released.

            In the IT and game development sectors they employ various programmers, 
            engineers and designers that have to come together to both create the games 
            and ensure the workflow remains at a stable pace. They use a proprietary 
            game engine called Decima, which is developed entirely in-house, 
            along with the Decima Editor to, of course, edit said engine. 
            There are also many, many other programs and developer environments in place, 
            including various animation tools, measuring and analysis tools, 
            online server environments and the game client itself.
          </p>

            In terms of company culture, they value artistry, creativity, 
            attention to detail and performance very highly. In order to 
            promote a respectful and creative workspace they have a fairly flat hierarchy. 
            This is intended to allow anyone to contribute ideas and opinions they might have.

            Altogether I believe the people at this company are incredibly ambitious 
            and strive to make great things, which clearly gets them results if you look at 
            the Horizon games. What I like the most, however, is how well-divided 
            the workload is among the different sections of the company, 
            which should hopefully mean that, as long as communication goes smoothly, 
            no one employee gets too much on their plate. Of course the amount 
            they do get is a challenge, given the high standards of the company, 
            but I also believe that it is a challenge that will almost certainly 
            yield worthwhile results.
